// Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}”
// Output: Balanced

// Input: exp = “[(])”
// Output: Not Balanced
/**
 *
 * Given an expression that is composed of 3 kinds of parenthesis "(","{" and "[", determine if the parenthesis are balanced.
 * @example [{}]() balanced
 * @example [{} not balanced (missing "]")
 * @example ([{}]() not balanced (missing a closing "(" for the first paren)
 * Hint: use a stack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) to keep track of opened parenthesis
 * Detailed solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-balanced-parentheses-in-an-expression/
