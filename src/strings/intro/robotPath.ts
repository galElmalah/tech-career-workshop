 * You are a robot stranded somewhere on Mars and your only way to get to your base is to follow a path given to you in following format:
 * U: move up 1 step
 * D: move down 1 step
 * R: move right 1 step
 * L: move left 1 step
 * 
 * Your path decoder somehow got broken when you landed on mars but luckily enough you can re programme yourself and create a new decoder
 * 
 * You can assume that your starting point is 0,0. 
 * Decode the path and return the end coordinates :)
